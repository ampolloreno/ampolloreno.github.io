As someone who has for a long time wanted to:
A) become a better writer
B) have engaging conversations
C) start a blog **and**
D) put something of substance on this webpage,

it seems like now is the economically sensible time to write something. Quarantine has the click supply at an all time high. So here goes -
{% highlight python %}
print("Hello, world!")
{% endhighlight %}

The earliest memory I have of 2019 available at simple recall was a day long [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) workshop. If you don't know what agile is... prepare for *enlightenment*.

In fact, I was so *enlightened* that I booked a red-eye flight to Cancún to see Dead and Company with a couple of coworkers. This was mid-January - we'll say the year started here.

I think I saw Dead and company 13 times last year. It took me the whole year to figure out why I like live music - but maybe that's because my whole reason is the years worth of live music I've seen.

Some of my favorite shows? The Gorge Amphitheater was beautiful. Celebrating New Year's with my family at the Chase Center was a quintessentially *us* thing to do. The venue in Cancún is also really amazing - warm weather and wind are two things I love. And for anyone who isn't familiar with Dead and Company/The Grateful Dead - they are *the* jam band. Each rendition of a song is different, and quite often substantially so. In fact, it's common for concert-goers to try to guess what song is being played or led into, sometimes even minutes in.

I am grateful for the opportunities presented to me to travel around and hear this music. Attending live music with friends is something I plan to keep doing. Part of the experience is the venue. Part of it is the trip. Part of it is the music. The songs stick with you in a way that I'm not convinced they otherwise would. You hear new music.

Speaking of concerts, I also went to Outside Lands for the third time (Paul Simon was there!), and Coachella for the first time. I saw John Mayer at the Chase Center in San Francisco. 2019 was really the most live music I have ever attended.

I'm also now officially becoming a scientist! I put my first preprint on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02779). I presented at [March Meeting](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR19/Session/X35.10) and [SQuInT](http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/2020/abstracts.php?person_id=1075). I've found two amazing advisors to pursue a Ph.D. with.

2019 was not an easy year. My relationship of nine years came to an end. I lost two grandparents and my relationship with one of my closest friends became untenable.

2019 was a year of change. I left my first job to pursue a Ph.D. I left California, my home of twenty five years, and moved to Colorado.

2019 was my most challenging year so far. I have been depressed and anxious, and not myself. But that doesn't make it bad year. I learned a lot -  I'm still learning a lot - and that's the only way forward.

Growth is really, really hard. But growth is really, really great. Thanks to all my friends for growing with me, and thanks for spending your time reading this. I hope we can see each other again soon.

Stay Healthy,
Anthony
