Hello! I am a first year graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm interested in a lot of things - my research focuses on quantum computing, quantum information and AMO theory.

I'm just getting into the swing of things, so the site is bare bones but I'm hoping to start up a few things - tracking papers and books I'm reading, blogging about things I find interesting, and putting up quotes and other cutesy things.

If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by. Come back soon - hopefully I'll have updated this page by then!
