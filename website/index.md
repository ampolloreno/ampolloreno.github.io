Hi! My name is **Anthony Polloreno**. <img src="/assets/images/portrait.jpg" align="right"> This site will be home to a personal blog about my life and technical notes. You can navigate to my CV for the full time history of my career, but said briefly:
1. I grew up in Southern California, and went to [San Dieguito Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Dieguito_Academy)
2. I got my BA from [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley) (go bears!)
3. I worked at [Rigetti Quantum Computing](https://rigetti.com/) in Berkeley as a software engineer and experimental physicist
4. I am now a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, Boulder ('sko buffs!)

I do research in quantum information and computation, and AMO theory.

Thanks for stopping by. You can reach me at the handles below.
