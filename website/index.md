Hello! You can navigate to my CV for the full time history of my career, but said briefly:
1. I grew up in southern California
2. I went to the University of California, Berkeley (Where my sister now goes!)
3. I worked at Rigetti Quantum Computing in Berkeley as a software engineer and experimental physicist
4. I am now a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

I study quantum information and computation, and AMO theory. Physics is interesting to me as a rich model of the world around us, but also because we can use it to engineer things - like computers.

In my free time I like to run and climb. More so now than ever, I also like to read and play guitar.

Thanks for stopping by. Maybe my favorite thing is people. You can reach me at the handles below.
