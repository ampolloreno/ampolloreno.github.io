    <p>As someone who has for a long time wanted to:
A) become a better writer
B) have engaging conversations
C) start a blog <strong>and</strong>
D) put something of substance on this webpage,</p>

<p>it seems like now is the economically sensible time to write something. Quarantine has the click supply at an all time high. So here goes -</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The earliest memory I have of 2019 available at simple recall was a day long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile</a> workshop. If you don’t know what agile is… prepare for <em>enlightenment</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, I was so <em>enlightened</em> that I booked a red-eye flight to Cancún to see Dead and Company with a couple of coworkers. This was mid-January - we’ll say the year started here.</p>

<p>I think I saw Dead and company 13 times last year. It took me the whole year to figure out why I like live music - but maybe that’s because my whole reason is the years worth of live music I’ve seen.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite shows? The Gorge Amphitheater was beautiful. Celebrating New Year’s with my family at the Chase Center was a quintessentially <em>us</em> thing to do. The venue in Cancún is also really amazing - warm weather and wind are two things I love. And for anyone who isn’t familiar with Dead and Company/The Grateful Dead - they are <em>the</em> jam band. Each rendition of a song is different, and quite often substantially so. In fact, it’s common for concert-goers to try to guess what song is being played or led into, sometimes even minutes in.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the opportunities presented to me to travel around and hear this music. Attending live music with friends is something I plan to keep doing. Part of the experience is the venue. Part of it is the trip. Part of it is the music. The songs stick with you in a way that I’m not convinced they otherwise would. You hear new music.</p>

<p>Speaking of concerts, I also went to Outside Lands for the third time (Paul Simon was there!), and Coachella for the first time. I saw John Mayer at the Chase Center in San Francisco. 2019 was really the most live music I have ever attended.</p>

<p>I’m also now officially becoming a scientist! I put my first preprint on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02779">arXiv</a>. I presented at <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR19/Session/X35.10">March Meeting</a> and <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/2020/abstracts.php?person_id=1075">SQuInT</a>. I’ve found two amazing advisors to pursue a Ph.D. with.</p>

<p>2019 was not an easy year. My relationship of nine years came to an end. I lost two grandparents and my relationship with one of my closest friends became untenable.</p>

<p>2019 was a year of change. I left my first job to pursue a Ph.D. I left California, my home of twenty five years, and moved to Colorado.</p>

<p>2019 was my most challenging year so far. I have been depressed and anxious, and not myself. But that doesn’t make it bad year. I learned a lot -  I’m still learning a lot - and that’s the only way forward.</p>

<p>Growth is really, really hard. But growth is really, really great. Thanks to all my friends for growing with me, and thanks for spending your time reading this. I hope we can see each other again soon.</p>

<p>Stay Healthy,
Anthony</p>
