<p>Hi! My name is <strong>Anthony Polloreno</strong>. <img src="/portrait.jpg" align="right" /> This site will be (an evolving) home to a personal blog about my life and technical notes. You can navigate to my CV for the full time history of my career, but said briefly:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>I grew up in Southern California, and went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Dieguito_Academy">San Dieguito Academy</a>.
            My grandfather frequently reminds me that my graduation quote was that "I want to learn everything there is
            to know." While being an obviously problematic statement at first glance, I have since discovered that even
            a weaker form of this goal is difficult to achieve. I'd like to relax the statement to "I want to put myself
            in a position to be able to understand anything I want, and additionally make an important contribution to
            the forefront of science." :)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I got my BA from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>
            (go bears!) Following in the wake of my high school optimism, I triple majored in computer science,
            mathematics, and physics. Thankfully, these three subjects are a relatively small, albeit still large in an
            absolute sense, subset of everything there is to know. At their intersection I found quantum computing,
            which has largely influenced my career trajectory since. Incidentally, after graduating from Berkeley,
            I was dedicated to <em>not</em> being a physicist, and only applied to computer science and mathematics
            programs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        During my last summer of college I interned at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandia_National_Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a>.
        This is really what kick started my career in quantum computing research.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigetti_Computing/">Rigetti Quantum Computing</a>
            in Berkeley as a software engineer and experimental physicist. My time at Rigetti was good - I met amazing
            people like <a href="https://mpharrigan.com/">Matt Harrigan</a>, <a href="https://stevenheidel.com/">Steven Heidel</a>,
            <a href="https://andremelo.org/">Andr&eacute Melo</a>, <a href="https://chromotopy.org/">Eric Peterson</a>,
            <a href="https://jotterbach.github.io/">Johannes Otterbach</a>, <a href="https://marcusps.github.io/">Marcus da Silva</a>,
            <a href="https://ntezak.github.io/">Nik Tezak</a>  and <a href="https://willzeng.com">Will Zeng</a>,
            contributed to a few <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=polloreno&terms-0-field=all&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-year=&date-filter_by=date_range&date-from_date=2016&date-to_date=2020&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-announced_date_first"> papers</a>,
            attended several conferences, and got a glimpse of industry life.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I am now a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, Boulder ('sko buffs!). I am interested in quantum information.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>In my free time I like to play guitar, climb, run, read, write and build relationships.</p>
