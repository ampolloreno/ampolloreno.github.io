This repository was started by Anthony Polloreno in 2017 in an attempt to start a website, and maintain his resume. Hopefully as time goes on it will become more well maintained. To get going you need to python Python and Ruby, and should run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To get Ruby installed, at least one Ubuntu, look here: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/

And to get jekyll working...
