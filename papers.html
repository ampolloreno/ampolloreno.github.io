    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony M. Polloreno</p>
    <p>In this work, we bound a machine's ability to learn based on computational
limitations implied by physicality. We start by considering the information
processing capacity (IPC), a normalized measure of the expected squared error
of a collection of signals to a complete basis of functions. We use the IPC to
measure the degradation under noise of the performance of reservoir computers,
a particular kind of recurrent network, when constrained by physical
considerations. First, we show that the IPC is at most a polynomial in the
system size \(n\), even when considering the collection of \(2^n\) possible
pointwise products of the \(n\) output signals. Next, we argue that this
degradation implies that the family of functions represented by the reservoir
requires an exponential number of samples to learn in the presence of the
reservoir's noise. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the performance of
the same collection of \(2^n\) functions without noise when being used for binary
classification.</p>

    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony M. Polloreno, Kevin C. Young</p>
    <p>Coherent errors in quantum operations are ubiquitous. Whether arising from
spurious environmental couplings or errors in control fields, such errors can
accumulate rapidly and degrade the performance of a quantum circuit
significantly more than an average gate fidelity may indicate. As Hastings [1]
and Campbell [2] have recently shown, by replacing the deterministic
implementation of a quantum gate with a randomized ensemble of implementations,
on can dramatically suppress coherent errors. Our work begins by reformulating
the results of Hastings and Campbell as a quantum optimal control problem. We
then discuss a family of convex programs designed to improve the performance,
implementability, and robustness of the resulting mixed quantum gates. Finally,
we implement these mixed quantum gates on a superconducting qubit and discuss
randomized benchmarking results consistent with a marked reduction in the
coherent error.

  Codes</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ariel Shlosberg, Anthony M. Polloreno, Graeme Smith</p>
    <p>Quantum error correction is necessary to perform large-scale quantum
computations in the presence of noise and decoherence. As a result, several
aspects of quantum error correction have already been explored. These have been
primarily studies of quantum memory[1, 2], an important first step towards
quantum computation, where the objective is to increase the lifetime of the
encoded quantum information. Additionally, several works have explored the
implementation of logical gates[3-5]. In this work we study a next step -
fault-tolerantly implementing quantum circuits. We choose the \([[4, 1, 2]]\)
Bacon-Shor subsystem code, which has a particularly simple error-detection
circuit. Through both numerics and site-counting arguments, we compute
pseudo-thresholds for the Pauli error rate \(p\) in a depolarizing noise model,
below which the encoded circuits outperform the unencoded circuits. These
pseudo-threshold values are shown to be as high as \(p=3\%\) for short circuits,
and \(p=0.6\%\) for circuits of moderate depth. Additionally, we see that
multiple rounds of stabilizer measurements give an improvement over performing
a single round at the end. This provides a concrete suggestion for a
small-scale fault-tolerant demonstration of a quantum algorithm that could be
accessible with existing hardware.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06845v5" target="_blank">The QAOA with Few Measurements</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony M. Polloreno, Graeme Smith</p>
    <p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) was originally
developed to solve combinatorial optimization problems, but has become a
standard for assessing the performance of quantum computers. Fully descriptive
benchmarking techniques are often prohibitively expensive for large numbers of
qubits (\(n \gtrsim 10\)), so the QAOA often serves in practice as a
computational benchmark. The QAOA involves a classical optimization subroutine
that attempts to find optimal parameters for a quantum subroutine.
Unfortunately, many optimizers used for the QAOA require many shots ($N \gtrsim
1000$) per point in parameter space to get a reliable estimate of the energy
being minimized. However, some experimental quantum computing platforms such as
neutral atom quantum computers have slow repetition rates, placing unique
requirements on the classical optimization subroutine used in the QAOA in these
systems. In this paper we investigate the performance of two choices of
gradient-free classical optimizer for the QAOA - dual annealing and natural
evolution strategies - and demonstrate that optimization is possible even with
\(N=1\) and \(n=16\).</p>

    <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05196v2" target="_blank">Individual qubit addressing of rotating ion crystals in a Penning trap</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony M. Polloreno, Ana Maria Rey, John J. Bollinger</p>
    <p>Trapped ions boast long coherence times and excellent gate fidelities, making
them a useful platform for quantum information processing. Scaling to larger
numbers of ion qubits in RF Paul traps demands great effort. Another technique
for trapping ions is via a Penning trap where a 2D crystal of hundreds of ions
is formed by controlling the rotation of the ions in the presence of a strong
magnetic field. However, the rotation of the ion crystal makes single ion
addressability a significant challenge. We propose a protocol that takes
advantage of a deformable mirror to introduce AC Stark shift patterns that are
static in the rotating frame of the crystal. Through numerical simulations we
validate the potential of this protocol to perform high-fidelity single-ion
gates in crystalline arrays of hundreds of ions.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13853v1" target="_blank">A Theory of Direct Randomized Benchmarking</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony M. Polloreno, Arnaud Carignan-Dugas, Jordan Hines, Robin Blume-Kohout, Kevin Young, Timothy Proctor</p>
    <p>Randomized benchmarking (RB) protocols are widely used to measure an average
error rate for a set of quantum logic gates. However, the standard version of
RB is limited because it only benchmarks a processor's native gates indirectly,
by using them in composite \(n\)-qubit Clifford gates. Standard RB's reliance on
\(n\)-qubit Clifford gates restricts it to the few-qubit regime, because the
fidelity of a typical composite \(n\)-qubit Clifford gate decreases rapidly with
increasing \(n\). Furthermore, although standard RB is often used to infer the
error rate of native gates, by rescaling standard RB's error per Clifford to an
error per native gate, this is an unreliable extrapolation. Direct RB is a
method that addresses these limitations of standard RB, by directly
benchmarking a customizable gate set, such as a processor's native gates. Here
we provide a detailed introduction to direct RB, we discuss how to design
direct RB experiments, and we present two complementary theories for direct RB.
The first of these theories uses the concept of error propagation or scrambling
in random circuits to show that direct RB is reliable for gates that experience
stochastic Pauli errors. We prove that the direct RB decay is a single
exponential, and that the decay rate is equal to the average infidelity of the
benchmarked gates, under broad circumstances. This theory shows that group
twirling is not required for reliable RB. Our second theory proves that direct
RB is reliable for gates that experience general gate-dependent Markovian
errors, using similar techniques to contemporary theories for standard RB. Our
two theories for direct RB have complementary regimes of applicability, and
they provide complementary perspectives on why direct RB works. Together these
theories provide comprehensive guarantees on the reliability of direct RB.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05520v2" target="_blank">Opportunities and Limitations in Broadband Sensing</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony M. Polloreno, Jacob L. Beckey, Joshua Levin, Ariel Shlosberg, James K. Thompson, Michael Foss-Feig, David Hayes, Graeme Smith</p>
    <p>We consider estimating the magnitude of a monochromatic AC signal that
couples to a two-level sensor. For any detection protocol, the precision
achieved depends on the signal's frequency and can be quantified by the quantum
Fisher information. To study limitations in broadband sensing, we introduce the
integrated quantum Fisher information and derive inequality bounds that embody
fundamental tradeoffs in any sensing protocol. These inequalities show that
sensitivity in one frequency range must come at a cost of reduced sensitivity
elsewhere. For many protocols, including those with small phase accumulation
and those consisting of \(\pi\)-pulses, we find the integrated Fisher information
scales linearly with \(T\). We also find protocols with substantial phase
accumulation can have integrated QFI that grows quadratically with \(T\), which
is optimal. These protocols may allow the very rapid detection of a signal with
unknown frequency over a very wide bandwidth.</p>

    <p>In state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms, including superconducting
qubits and trapped ions, imperfections in the 2-qubit entangling gates are the
dominant contributions of error to system-wide performance. Recently, a novel
2-qubit parametric gate was proposed and demonstrated with superconducting
transmon qubits. This gate is activated through RF modulation of the transmon
frequency and can be operated at an amplitude where the performance is
first-order insensitive to flux-noise. In this work we experimentally validate
the existence of this AC sweet spot and demonstrate its dependence on white
noise power from room temperature electronics. With these factors in place, we
measure coherence-limited entangling-gate fidelities as high as 99.2 \(\pm\)
0.15%.</p>

    <p>Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing devices are an exciting platform
for the exploration of the power of near-term quantum applications. Performing
nontrivial tasks in such devices requires a fundamentally different approach
than what would be used on an error-corrected quantum computer. One such
approach is to use hybrid algorithms, where problems are reduced to a
parameterized quantum circuit that is often optimized in a classical feedback
loop. Here we describe one such hybrid algorithm for machine learning tasks by
building upon the classical algorithm known as random kitchen sinks. Our
technique, called quantum kitchen sinks, uses quantum circuits to nonlinearly
transform classical inputs into features that can then be used in a number of
machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of this
proposal by using it to solve binary classification problems for synthetic
datasets as well as handwritten digits from the MNIST database. Using the
Rigetti quantum virtual machine, we show that small quantum circuits provide
significant performance lift over standard linear classical algorithms,
reducing classification error rates from 50% to \(<0.1\%\), and from \(4.1\%\) to
\(1.4\%\) in these two examples, respectively. Further, we are able to run the
MNIST classification problem, using full-sized MNIST images, on a Rigetti
quantum processing unit, finding a modest performance lift over the linear
baseline.</p>

    <p>We describe and implement a family of entangling gates activated by
radio-frequency flux modulation applied to a tunable transmon that is
statically coupled to a neighboring transmon. The effect of this modulation is
the resonant exchange of photons directly between levels of the two-transmon
system, obviating the need for mediating qubits or resonator modes and allowing
for the full utilization of all qubits in a scalable architecture. The
resonance condition is selective in both the frequency and amplitude of
modulation and thus alleviates frequency crowding. We demonstrate the use of
three such resonances to produce entangling gates that enable universal quantum
computation: one iSWAP gate and two distinct controlled Z gates. We report
interleaved randomized benchmarking results indicating gate error rates of 6%
for the iSWAP (duration 135ns) and 9% for the controlled Z gates (durations 175
ns and 270 ns), limited largely by qubit coherence.</p>

    <p>We show that parametric coupling techniques can be used to generate selective
entangling interactions for multi-qubit processors. By inducing coherent
population exchange between adjacent qubits under frequency modulation, we
implement a universal gateset for a linear array of four superconducting
qubits. An average process fidelity of \(\mathcal{F}=93\%\) is estimated for
three two-qubit gates via quantum process tomography. We establish the
suitability of these techniques for computation by preparing a four-qubit
maximally entangled state and comparing the estimated state fidelity against
the expected performance of the individual entangling gates. In addition, we
prepare an eight-qubit register in all possible bitstring permutations and
monitor the fidelity of a two-qubit gate across one pair of these qubits.
Across all such permutations, an average fidelity of \(\mathcal{F}=91.6\pm2.6\%\)
is observed. These results thus offer a path to a scalable architecture with
high selectivity and low crosstalk.</p>
